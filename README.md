# Notepad
Postman tests API for Notepad https://thinking-tester-contact-list.herokuapp.com/.
Everytime to add new User yoy have to change the email adress by yourself, for example Oxana400@fake.com, Oxana401@fake.com.
I cannot delete my user by Postman, but all my tests work like it needs to be.
Email, password, token, user ID, and contact ID were written in variables.
